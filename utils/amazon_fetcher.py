# Curl_cffi is a life saver really, helped bypass amazon request block thingy successfully!
# I thought I would have to use selenium or similar, but thankfully not! otherwise would have had to cancel this project
# Selinum won't work with hosts (Atleast not on the one I use!)
# As the main goal is to automate the fetching part. I don't want to have a static site instead, 
# dynamic not only sounds cool, but is cooler as well :>

# On to the main topic, this won't do. We can't be certain when amazon decides to block the request.
# I'll use sqlite database to store these results of successfull fetches in advance to add a fallback
# Incase request fails to run successfully.

    `['78 percent of reviews have 5 stars', '22 percent of reviews have 2 stars']` with total_rating as 6
